# What is RideSheet?

A simple, spreadsheet-based tool for small demand-responsive transportation (DRT) services

---

## RideSheet might be for you, if...

- You operate a small DRT service with 10 or fewer vehicles
- Your organization currently uses paper, whiteboards, or basic spreadsheets to track rides
- You're ready to start making more of your processes digital

RideSheet is **spreadsheet-based**. It is based on Google Sheets and requires a Google Workspace account and a reliable internet connection. Most organizations will also need technical help setting it up.

## What RideSheet Does

### Tracking

RideSheet serves as a database for tracking Trips, Runs, Customers, Drivers, Vehicles, and Services. These records are easy to add, edit, and sort, because they are stored in a spreadsheet. 

Past data is moved to review and then archived, allowing for a comprehensive record of all trips and runs.

### Reporting

RideSheet can automatically produce reports from trip data and calculate billable trip duration and mileage. It can be configured to handle multiple funding sources and services, and customized to fit your organization's reporting needs.

### Driver Manifests

Printable driver manifests for the day can be quickly generated. The driver manifest is a fully customizable template.

### Features

- Address autocomplete from common locations (e.g. Petsmart, Bend OR)
- Autofill estimated hours and mileage from Google Maps
- Automatic backups and version history
- "In the cloud" - live collaboration available from any computer

!!! info "What RideSheet Isn't"
