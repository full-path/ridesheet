# What is RideSheet?

A simple, spreadsheet-based tool for small demand-responsive transportation (DRT) services

---

## RideSheet might be for you, if...

- You operate a small DRT service with 10 or fewer vehicles
- Your organization currently uses paper, whiteboards, or basic spreadsheets to track rides
- You're ready to start making more of your processes digital

RideSheet is **spreadsheet-based**. It is based on Google Sheets and requires a Google Workspace account and a reliable internet connection. Most organizations will also need technical help setting it up.

## What RideSheet Does

### Tracking

RideSheet serves as a database for tracking Trips, Runs, Customers, Drivers, Vehicles, and Services. These records are easy to add, edit, and sort, because they are stored in a spreadsheet. 

Past data is moved to review and then archived, allowing for a comprehensive record of all trips and runs.

### Reporting

RideSheet can automatically produce reports from trip data and calculate billable trip duration and mileage. It can be configured to handle multiple funding sources and services, and customized to fit your organization's reporting needs.

### Driver Manifests

Printable driver manifests for the day can be quickly generated. The driver manifest is a fully customizable template.

### Features

- Address autocomplete from common locations (e.g. Petsmart, Bend OR)
- Autofill estimated hours and mileage from Google Maps
- Automatic backups and version history
- "In the cloud" - live collaboration available from any computer

!!! info "What RideSheet Isn't"

    RideSheet is not a "smart" app. It will not make scheduling suggestions or optimizations. 

## Success with RideSheet

If RideSheet sounds right for your organization, there are a few things you can do to make sure that the switch is a success. 

RideSheet is affordable. The base costs for hosting it are just a [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/pricing) account. However, most organizations will need help installing RideSheet, and will benefit from a support plan to help with any issues that arise, and to ensure software updates are installed regularly. Any plan to get RideSheet should account for ongoing support & maintenance. 

Your organization should also have a **plan for security**. Google Workspace has many security features, but especially if you are moving from paper, it's important to have a plan in place for [cybersecurity basics](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/small-businesses/cybersecurity/basics), such as staff training in password management and how to use [multi-factor authentication](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/use-two-factor-authentication-protect-your-accounts).

Finally, **plan for training**. It's important to train users to use Google Workspace effectively and set them up for success, especially if staff are new to cloud-based applications and are only familiar with applications and files that are stored on their local computer or network. 

## Trip Sharing with other Organizations

RideSheet is engaged in several pilot programs to implement [TDS: The Transactional Data Specification](https://blog.aarp.org/the-transactional-data-specification). This allows organizations in the same service area to share trips and refer customers. If you are interested in using RideSheet for TDS, please get in touch.
