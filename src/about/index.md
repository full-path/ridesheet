## Security and Compliance

Google Workspace has a business associate agreement (BAA) in place that meets the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This means that Google Workspace can be used to store and process private health information (PHI) without violating HIPAA regulations. The Google Workspace BAA is available to all customers who use Google Workspace for HIPAA-regulated purposes. To sign the BAA, customers must contact Google and provide certain information, such as the name and address of their covered entity. Once the BAA is signed, customers can use Google Workspace to store and process PHI in accordance with HIPAA regulations. Google will take steps to protect the PHI, such as encrypting it at rest and in transit and limiting access to it only to authorized personnel.

To implement HIPAA compliance:

1. Contact Google to initiate the BAA process
2. Provide required organization information
3. Follow Google's compliance guidelines for PHI handling
4. Maintain appropriate access controls and security practices
