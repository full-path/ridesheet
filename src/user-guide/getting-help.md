# Getting Help

In most cases, you should contact whoever installed RideSheet for your organization. You can also reach out to Full Path at: ridesheet-support@fullpath.io

You can also request to join the RideSheet Users Group, which meets periodically over Zoom, by reaching out over the support email. 

For technical users, if you suspect you have encountered a bug, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/full-path/ridesheet/issues).
