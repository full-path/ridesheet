# User Guide

This guide is for current RideSheet users. It covers all of the key processes and workflows, provides detailed information about the different sheets and fields, and offers troubleshooting tips for when RideSheet is not working as expected.

If the information you are looking for is not in this guide, it is likely because the feature is part of a custom installation. If you had RideSheet installed for you by Full Path, you likely have a separate user guide covering all customizations. Otherwise, please contact whomever installed and set up RideSheet for your organization for support. If none of those options work, try [Getting Help].
