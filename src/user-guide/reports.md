# Reports

RideSheet allows you to create custom reports and automatically calculate billable mileage on a per-service basis.

## Overview

RideSheet is extremely flexible when it comes to reporting. The data in Trip Archive and Run Archive can be used to calculate key metrics for NTD reports and other business analytics. 

Older versions of RideSheet may have reports built into a separate Google Sheet. It's possible to use RideSheet archives as a database and pull them into another spreadsheet for analysis.

Newer installations of RideSheet are migrating to using [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/overview). This guide will eventually cover how to set up Looker Studio with your copy of RideSheet.
