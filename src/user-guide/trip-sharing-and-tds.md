# Trip Sharing and TDS

Some installations of RideSheet implement TDS (Transactional Data Specification), an open data specification for sharing trips between agencies. Installing, configuring, and using Trip Sharing is beyond the scope of this guide.

If you have Trip Sharing enabled in your RideSheet, please contact the technician who installed your copy of RideSheet for support.
