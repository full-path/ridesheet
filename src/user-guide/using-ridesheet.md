This screenshot comes from the [RideSheet Public Sample](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U_rmR08qW63hEK_5IWblzVXK4ZqQElaD1ymAQNGpNiU/edit#gid=0). If you are interested in trying out RideSheet, you can simply make a copy of this sheet and test out anything you would like, or use it to follow along with this guide.

The first row of the spreadsheet, in yellow, is the header. Most of these fields are covered in detail in [Data Fields](data-fields.md)

Along the bottom, you can see the various tabs, such as Customers, Trips, and Runs. You will probably need to scroll to see all of the different sheets.

In the main menu, you can see a dropdown menu item for **RideSheet**. This where you will run many of the workflows mentioned in this guide.
